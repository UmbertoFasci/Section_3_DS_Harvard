## Random Variables

Numeric outcomes resulting from a random process.

### Simple Example

Define `x` to be 1 if a bead is blue, and red otherwise.

```{r echo=TRUE}
beads <- rep(c("red", "blue"), times = c(2, 3))
X <- ifelse(sample(beads, 1) == "blue", 1, 0)
X2 <- ifelse(sample(beads, 1) == "blue", 1, 0)
X3 <- ifelse(sample(beads, 1) == "blue", 1, 0)
X4 <- ifelse(sample(beads, 1) == "blue", 1, 0)
X
X2
X3
X4
```
